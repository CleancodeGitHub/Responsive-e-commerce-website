I've created a modern, responsive e-commerce website with the following features:

Navbar with:

Mobile-responsive menu
Search functionality
Cart and user account icons
Clean dropdown navigation
Hero section with:

Full-width background image
Call-to-action buttons
Overlay text
Product Grid showing:

Featured products
Product images
Pricing
Add-to-cart functionality
Wishlist button
Newsletter section for email subscriptions

Detailed footer with:

Company information
Quick links
Social media icons
Contact information
The components are organized into separate files for
 better maintainability and reusability. The design uses Tailwind
 CSS for styling and Lucide React for icons, making it lightweight and performant.
